## News & Updates

### 16 January 2024

Prof. Amy Angert at the University of British Columbia wrote an awesome commentary piece about our ponderosa paper that just came out [here](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2320424121), titled *"The space-for-time gambit fails a robust test"*. She does a really great job contextualizing our findings and discussing some of the eco-evolutionary mechanisms that may underlie them. I'm a huge fan of her work in general, and thrilled that she found this work compelling.

### December 2023

It's finally out! Beyond excited that my final dissertation chapter is over the finish line and out in the world. Check it out [here](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2304404120) in PNAS. It's wild to think that the data in this paper were collected almost five and a half years ago. Hopefully this paper helps moves the climate change biogeography field away from simple space-for-time substitution, and toward a more nuanced, temporally-informed approach... still lots of work to do to get there!

The picture below is from one of my favorite field sites from that study, an isolated pocket of ponderosa pine up West Rosebud Creek in the Beartooths in SW Montana:

### August 2023

Had a wonderful time in Portland at the 2023 ESA meeting -- you can find materials from the "Intro to FIA for Ecologists" workshop [here](https://github.com/daniel-perret/FIA-workshop-ESA2023). Awesome working with great friends and colleagues putting this together -- Bailey McLaughlin, Jane Terzibashian, and Harold Zald.
