I'm an ORISE Postdoctoral Research Fellow with the US Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station. I'm an ecologist and biogeographer, and although my current research focuses on trees, I've worked with species ranging from wolves to sage grouse to mountain beavers. I'm always excited to learn about new systems and cool critters!


Outside of science, I really enjoy interacting with the physical landscape around our home in Missoula, MT. My favorite ways to do this are mountain biking, backcountry skiing, whitewater kayaking, and trail running. These are best enjoyed with my awesome wife and kick-ass wildlife biologist [Molly McDevitt](https://www.umt.edu/environment/personnel/grads.php?ID=5830) and our sweet doggo Barley. I also make music, and you might be able to catch me playing bluegrass and swing mandolin around western Montana with [Spruce Alley Sally](https://sprucealleysally.wixsite.com/mysite).
