  I'm a biogeographer, forest ecologist, and dendrochronologist. I'm currently an ORISE Postdoctoral Research Fellow with the US Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station. 
  <br><br>
  My work seeks to understand and predict the dramatic ways that human actions are altering the planet's ecology, with the goal if improving conservation and management outcomes. My current research leverages large-scale forest inventory data, tree-ring records, non-native distributions, and ecological niche theory to investigate the future of western North American forests in light of changing climatic and disturbance regimes.

  On this website, you'll find brief descriptions of my current and past research, my CV, and links to other relevant pages.
